Pamaxie was developed to ensure and verify the the security of content and media on the internet.
This was developed to allow developers of chat applications to moderate content automatically. For example by a neural network scanning images for certain properties, and we plan on supporting other types of media as well. The intention of this connection of Machine Learning and statically typed algorythms is to create a service that allows the internet to be more secure. Our goal is to make the web more fun and safe to browse, and prevent users from seeing content on websites that they, may want to avoid

We are developing this API with content hosters in mind. We will never share any data or sell it to 3rd parties. We will always treat all user data that we keep on our servers with the highest respect for privacy. This is one of the reasons that we chose to make this an open source project. Our API will be developed to be easy to interact with and stay as responsive as possible.

The end goal of the project is to make the internet a more secure place to browse.
Our API can be either trained with your own data. 
If you don't want to train your own data, you can just access our API for free by just creating an account on our website. 

### We will release further updates on the wiki once the API is available for public signup.
